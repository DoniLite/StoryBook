# StoryBook Project

This project is a little blog page that includes some features provided by the [Ghostify](https://ghostify.site/) project API  
It's used to parse markdown files in HTML pages which contain the blog content

## Why this project?

I would litterally like to publish me blog articles in different site like [Ghostify](https://ghostify.site/) but i think that some subjects have to be explained in a different context to be understood properly. In addition this project has been developed for a specific mission and for some specific subjects wich are *backend* subjects and *API implementation*.
